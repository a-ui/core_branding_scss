# Antwerp Core Branding

This project contains Antwerp's digital styling and styling guidelines. It is the starting point to style your app or website for the city of Antwerp.

## Getting started

In its simplest form you can just include the following line in the `<head>` section of your app.

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.antwerpen.be/core_branding_scss/7.0.0/main.min.css">
```

You can even import it directly in your (S)CSS:

```
@import url("https://cdn.antwerpen.be/core_branding_scss/7.0.0/main.min.css");
```

> We adopt semantic versioning. If you want to use another version of the Core Branding you can do so by adjusting the version in the URL address. See the changelog for all available versions.

You can also install everything with npm:

npm install @a-ui/core --save
